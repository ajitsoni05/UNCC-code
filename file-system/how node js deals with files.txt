- hard drive consists of various sequences of bytes
- os runs on top of hard drive
- Node js is one of the process running 
- When dealing with files with the node ,it actually talks to os using system calls
For example, when we are opening the file . node js calls open() system-call(os command) to os which in turns find the file and open the file, gets the bytes 
and opens it 
- Nodejs using Libuv calls the open() system call
- rename() system call to rename the file (these all calls are being done using Libuv library by node js)
- Threadpool libuv
