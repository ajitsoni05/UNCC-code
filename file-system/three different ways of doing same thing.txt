file system can use three types of API
in node js , we can use
- promises API
- call back API
- synchronous API

these ways do the same thing (for ex deleting a file , creating a file)

the question aries , how and which api should we use 

- for 90 percent of the time , we can use promises api 
- when we want maximum performance , we can use the callback api ( faster than the promises api)
- try to stay away from synchronous api as much as possible

- When we use synchronous api , we are actually blocking the main thread
